## Task

> Find user.txt and root.txt file in the victimâ€™s machine.

## Solution

First thing first, nmap:

`nmap -sV -sC -oA NmapScan -v 10.10.10.3`

The results of this scan will be the only thing we need!

```bash
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3

We see some `vsftpd  v2.3.4` with anonymous access and also some informations reguarding the `Samba v3.0.20` service. 

I first tried to access the ftp service with anonymous credentials (user : `anonymous`, psw : `anonymous`) but nothing was there.

Then I searched for an *ftp v2.3.4* exploit using Metasploit and found a *Backdoor Command Execution*, it didn't work for some reason.

Finally there was a vulnerability in that Samba v3.0.20, a *username map script Command Execution* that worked! 

In Metasploit it's under:

Changing the `RHOST` to the ip of the machine and the `LHOST` to the ip of the *tun0* interface (because of the connection through the vpn) we'll successfully obtain a shell.

Let's verify if Python exists on the system:

`which python`

Python is there, let's make a quick and simple TTY with the command:

`shell`

and rom here we just navigate a little bit to find both the user flag (`/home/makis`) and the root flag (`root`) available!
